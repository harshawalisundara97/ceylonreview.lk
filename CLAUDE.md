# Git & Release Workflow — Follow Strictly

## 1. Branching
- Never commit or push directly to `main`.
- All work (features, bug fixes) happens on a dedicated branch off `main`:
  - `feature/<short-name>` for new features
  - `fix/<short-name>` for bug fixes
- Branch names should be short, lowercase, hyphenated.

## 2. During development
- Keep commits scoped to the branch's purpose.
- Test manually as we go, but do not consider the branch "done" until Section 3 is complete.

## 3. Before opening a Pull Request
Before I say "create a PR" / "let's PR this", you must:
1. Check whether test cases exist for the feature/fix being touched, **and** for any existing related features that currently lack tests. If missing, write them.
2. Run the full test suite locally and show me the results.
3. GitHub Actions CI is configured at `.github/workflows/flutter-ci.yml` (runs `flutter analyze` + `flutter test` on every push/PR to `main`). Confirm it passes — check the workflow file and, if possible, the latest run status — before proceeding.
4. Only after tests + build are green, open the PR.
5. Do not silently skip any of steps 1–4. If something can't be run (e.g., no CI configured yet), tell me explicitly instead of assuming it's fine.

## 4. After PR approval & merge
- Once a PR is approved and merged into `main`, **ask me for confirmation before deleting the feature branch** (both local and remote, if applicable). Never delete it automatically.
- Wait for my explicit "yes, delete it" before running the delete.

## 5. General rule of thumb
- Test coverage first, PR second, merge third, branch cleanup last (with my confirmation).
- If any step is ambiguous or CI/test setup is missing in a given repo, flag it and ask rather than guessing.

## 6. Documenting repeated workflows
- If I do the same manual step twice in a session on this repo (e.g. a migration applied by hand, a recurring verification command, a recurring manual test-run), write it into a project doc as a documented, repeatable step instead of just repeating it silently a third time.
  - Prefer adding it to the most relevant existing doc (this file, `README.md`, `app/README.md`, or `docs/BACKEND_PLAN.md`) over creating a new file.
  - Say what you're adding and where, in one line, so it's visible rather than silent.
- This does not apply to one-off debugging commands or anything already covered by CI (Section 3) — only to steps that would otherwise silently recur.
